#  RustyWeb dry-run (in English, BBC internal audience) on 2013-09-24:

## Feedback, comments and ideas


### General

* The talk itself was 35 minutes, with 20 minutes discussion. Lively discussion, the ten-or-so in the audience were clearly inspired by the topic. 

### Beginning / value of info / Choice
* The beginning is too long/slow. Note: we could skip most of the beginning and start with the shop receipt (mention the rosetta stone quickly in the process)
* On the question "value of information is hard to define and measure" there was a comment about "quantified self" and the fact that it only starts being useful after a while, when you start seeing emerging patterns
* Pattern recognition in general is an interesting concept. Information alone is often uninteresting. It gets interesting in context/in aggregation.
* Bank statements are another good example. The bank lets you access them online, but only a few months back. Again, the question of who decides to keep/throw.

### The Web as information management

* The part "Choix et Politique" wasn't very convincing. Too long-winded and unclear. Maybe talk less about concepts
* Talk about internet archive / WayBack machine. what is it doing right? not right?
* Spend more time on the web redesign. I was too fast there. Spend more time on the tension and the desire to do good.
* A bit too conceptual at times. More examples?
* Note that some content disappear because technology evolves
* Geocities as an interesting example - deleted with very little notice, community effort to salvage/copy everything. "a black hole in the web".
* The "lies in the present tense" should be more clearly linked to the question of "digital decay"
* I mentioned that "the good thing about the web is that it is built on open standards". Some feedback was "yes but for audio and video you need the decoder". 

### Web and Rust (Decay and Patina)
* Some did not like the "rust" metaphor. Not culturally acceptable to think as rust as a protective/good thing? A question of language too. (rust/rouille/vert-de-gris) Others in the audience mentioned the fact that oxidation does protect aluminium. 
* The audience was not sure "the rusty web" was a good/appealing title. I argued that the talk was as much about provoking thought on the effects of time on the web.   
* What about old-looking web design. Web design (look and feel and capabilities) has changed a lot over the years. Is that patina? The talk should address that.
* It is often hard to determine whether a page is "old" or not. Is it outdated? Is it actually still used and read today? What are the best practices to determine the "liveliness" of a web page.
* Patina - give examples of sites and people doing it right (whether they do it consciously or not). 


## Ideas that stuck -  a potential outline for the article (?)

### It's really hard to know the value of information over time
[examples: receipt]


### We need to go beyond the concepts of "infobesity" and "throwaway information"

* Why do we keep information? who for? Who decides? 

* Why do we throw away information when it's so cheap to keep? Why does it matter? Who decides?

* It's more about choice in the curation of now and the past

### Redesigns of web sites are difficult. 

There tends to be too much effort on a new "skin" and not enough thought about the evolution and preservation of content. It is not a matter of fate though - some sites (think twitter, flickr) managed to redesign their sites without necessarily throwing away content in the process. why?

### Digital decay, preservation, patina

We are making a mistake in trying to apply the usual concepts of "decay", "preservation" and "patina" to digital. It shows a misunderstanding of the different nature of digital: free/perfect copy and easy transmission.

* _decay_ - is not about degradation because most of the time digital information stays the same forever. On the contrary: decaying digital information is information that is not dated, not updated, not talked about, not findable. That information dies.
* _preservation_ and archives - not about preserving a single copy in a box. On the contrary, preservation of digital information is about making it easy to duplicate,distribute and appropriate it. Less of a "box in storage" model, more of a genetic/memetic model. A good digital archive is not necessarily about browsing content based on time, it is about finding information which nobody thought would be useful at the time, but is useful now.
* _patina_ is not about information slowly disappearing or photos fading to yellow. patina is not "vintage look" either - the design of 1990s website is cute and has a quaint feel but it is not patina. Patina is the "memory" of use, and the characteristics of things that are built to "get better with use". In the physical realm it is the sheen of wood polished and changed by the oil on our fingers. It is the colour of oxidation. In the digital realm, what is it? The accumulation of links, of content and metadata around information. Wikipedia or a page with a lot of incoming links and comments and commentary - is that a better example of web patina?
