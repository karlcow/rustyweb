# The web, its rust and patina

London. October 2013. 18:14. “Do you want the receipt in the bag? ” she asks. 

Yes please. I might need the receipt — having to walk through the whole supermarket to reach the exit at the other end, and Im always wondering whether some day they will stop me there and ask to prove I haven't dropped a can of beans or a bar of chocolate into my bag on the way through the aisles. The receipt, right here and right now, is an integral part of the social contract of trust between me and the shop. 

At the bottom of the receipt is written “retain for your records”. And indeed, through the next minutes, hours, weeks and years, the information encoded on this small slip of paper may be useful to me, and to others, in many different ways. 

For now, it is a way for me to prove that I have indeed paid for the groceries. In a few days, I could use it to return an unwanted item; in a month, I can compare it to a line on my bank statement; within the year it could be the proof of purchase I use to claim warranty on the unreliable battery charger. 

Beyond that, it gets blurry: in theory, this could be used in months or years by a trash-digging detective to detect patterns in my lifestyle; by a late 21st-century sociologist to study the cost of living and typical lifestyle of a middle-class male in 2013; or by a 40st-century archeologist to understand life in Europe at the turn of the millennium. Of course, they won't: even if I kept in a metal box for the rest of my life, the low quality of the ink and paper used would certainly make the receipt unreadable and unusable within a few years. 

Whoever designed this physical manifestation of the information about this transaction between the shop and I has decided that the short-term uses of the receipt are valid, but they did not deem archaeology to be a reasonable use case, and thus decided that a transient design for this receipt was acceptable. It might be a pity that this receipt is unlikely to be the rosetta stone of the 40th century; at least I don't have to carry a carved piece of stone in my wallet. And I tend to shred all my receipts anyway.

## Beyond "infobesity" and "throwaway information"

This is a conversation about information, and time… and what a better understanding of how the two interact means for the maturing medium that is the World Wide Web.

Whenever anyone talks about information and time, the cliché generally goes that we are in the midst of an “explosion of information”, where “more information is created in (insert very short time here) than in (enter a very long time here, but don't make it span beyond the invention of writing or the appearance of homo sapiens, that might hurt your credibility a bit)”. 

It may be more accurate to say that we are _recording_ more information than ever, but the tension around the hyperbolic need for systems to store and process information is a real one. Thus was coined the term _infobesity_, from _information_ and _obesity_. The term is obviously loaded with judgement about whether we, as individuals or as a society, should really be storing and keeping so much information about what we all do, see and think. This denotes an underlying belief that there are several types of information, roughly split between _throwaway information_ and _valuable information_.

This value judgement is worth a bit of scrutiny. 

Assuming that indeed some information is more valuable than others, how do we determine the value of information. There is, as far as I know, no clear framework to score or rank the value of a piece of information. Information does derive value from the use we can make of it - commercial, educational, emotional - but the diversity of usage means that the value can be fiduciary just as well as it can be sentimental. 

Unsurprisingly, information as the currency of our postmodern era proves to be of a very subjective value. 

A better question, then, may be: 

## Why do we keep information? For whom? And who decides?

It is worth remembering the story of the [first website](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). Alive and well maintained from the beginnings of the web until at least 1993, when the web was given to the world, the site was later abandoned and simply put offline. 

The decision, it is to be assumed, was made not by the original author of the web site, but rather by the CERN caretakers of the machine on which it resided, and probably for cost-of-maintenance reasons. Plus, who cares about an outdated page about software nobody uses any more? 

It took the 20th anniversary of the opening of the web to the world for the community - alongside CERN - to realise the historical value of the site and [begin an effort](http://first-website.web.cern.ch/) to restore the site in its original location (both the URI and the machine on which the website used to run). What cannot be restored, of course, is its liveness - from living, breathing page, it is now a museum piece.

The removal of the first web site may actually be a remnant of an earlier age, where the physical support of information was costly, fragile and often took a lot of space and effort to preserve. Logically, the most important question about the preservation of information on physical media was “why should we keep this?”. Internet and the web changes that. Of course, there are still questions about the physical integrity of servers and hard drive, but advances in technology have generally made it cheaper and easier to keep information around (just in case it might be useful to someone, at some point).

## Preservation and culling in a digital world

[Recent](http://www.willodom.com/projects/chi2013/VodafoneFieldwork_CHI2013_CameraReady_V3.pdf) [studies](http://rebeccagulotta.com/docs/GulottaOdomForlizziFaste2013.pdf) with digital natives are a good example of this shift in perception. When presented with artificial mechanisms for decay and destruction of digital artefacts, teenagers and young adults generally appear baffled by the idea that digital artefacts, which by nature are nearly free to copy and keep, would be made to "age" and "disappear" over time.

This does not mean that the younger generation is keen to systematically hoard all information about their life: on the contrary, witness the success of transient-information services such as [Snapchat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat) or the new bill in California [mandating the addition of an "erase" feature](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB568) for teenagers on internet services.

The reality of information storage and preservation in an internet age is therefore more complex than mere hoarding or infobesity; it is no longer a question of determining whether information is valuable or not (and to whom), but rather to know  who ultimately decides between conservation or deletion.

Case in point - should social networks be allowed (or forced?) to keep all our old conversations and interactions? 

Some services (e.g. Twitter) have typically made it quite difficult to access content older than a few months old. Conversely, most such services rarely give an easy way to remove or hide large amount of old information on their services, prompting people ([like me](https://github.com/olivierthereaux/oldtweets)) to create their own tools for deletion and personal archival of their footprint on social media.

The question of whether to keep or destroy such information, it is important to note, is largely amoral. What may amount to an ethical question, however, is that of choice. Just as California lawmakers felt they had to pass a bill to force internet services to provide a "digital eraser" for teenagers' indiscretions, there is an ethical question about whether the choice to keep or delete information should be left to the service or given to the user.

## Web re-designs and the challenge of “preserving the web”

Another complicated case where the question of whether (and how) to preserve or let go of information on the web is that of the "redesign". Because we mostly think of "web design" as the look and feel (and only marginally the information architecture and the content itself), the idea of a "redesign" is often meant as a mere evolution of the colour scheme, stylesheets and logos. 

In reality, the stop-and-go nature of web development in most organisations means that a "redesign" will generally happen every few years, and involve not only a change in look or feel, but also a move from one content management system to another. Such a move is seldom easy and straightforward.  For lack of standard formats for export and import of data from one content management system to another, the migration of content from the "old" site to the "new" is often a pain in the neck. 

My last experience dealing with a "redesign" was, in this regard, a fairly typical one. When working on a new iteration of the [BBC Research and Development](http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd) web site, our team had decided to transition the management of the site from an array of legacy in-house systems to one based upon an open-source solution, and we knew that a perfect migration of all the content (thousands of publications, hundreds of project pages and hundreds of blog posts and other updates) would be too complex and costly given the limited time and budget allocated for this work. 

In the department, attitudes towards the "migration" (or not) of content was running an interesting gamut. While absolutely everyone was agreeing that every single technical publication made by BBC R&D in its decades of existence should be migrated, opinions on what to do with project pages varied wildly. We knew the pages would have to be "migrated" by hand - a tedious bit of work; or simply disappear. Some saw the redesign as a perfect opportunity to get rid of "outdated pages about old projects", others as a chance to fix and update information about work they'd done 10 or 20 years ago. Others again, having ignored the conversation until we'd finished the project and compromised over a first batch migration of content and a gradual migration of the rest over time, were horrified to see that links to some of their old projects were no longer going anywhere. 

## Tools and practices for the web as information space/time

Whenever a URI goes _404_ (The HTTP code for "Not Found"), we all lose. Of course, it could be argued that the very existence of the 404 is the one thing that made the web so free, flexible and ultimately robust: links are thrown one-way, and if there is nothing at the end of a link, the web as a system isn't broken. The user or agent sees an error, and moves on. Broken link are the blessing and curse of the web.

That said, there is a whole arsenal of tools at our disposal in the HTTP toolbox which allow us to avoid the dreaded 404. 

Redirections are powerful and useful. Whenever I worked on a “redesign”, one of my starting points is a map of all the URIs (if it can be retrieved or generated). Not only is it likely to be useful when doing any work on the future information architecture of content hierarchies, it will also be a great basis for a redirection map. Decide whether full sections should be redirected to a single resource. Make sure all the key pages are either still available at the same URI, or make sure they are redirected. Then you mostly need to add the generic redirection recipes - the ones dealing with the sometimes inevitable change in URI nomenclature imposed by the CMS; and while you're at it, try to ensure that your new set of URIs do not [needlessly expose your technology](http://www.w3.org/TR/chips/#cp3.1).

A lesser known, but no less meaningful member of the HTTP toolset is the Code 410 (Gone). Think of 410 as an unashamedly opinionated 404. Setting up an HTTP Status Code 410 on a web resource will have a fairly similar impact as a 404 on people  following a link: they will not see the resource they were looking for. But the error message makes all the difference: the difference between “oops, we must have misplaced this resource, or maybe you the user are an idiot and typed the URI wrong?“ and “This resource is gone. We made a choice to remove it. It may have been wrong, or we may just have decided it was no longer to our interest to have it on the web”. This difference matters.

Most of the tools allowing us to manage information on the web over time have actually little to do with HTTP or URIs. 

In an earlier post on [Digital Decay](http://olivier.thereaux.net/2013/01-Digital-Decay/) I wrote at length about how most information we contribute to the web is of the write-and-forget kind, and as a result, how it quickly gets outdated: my [bio for Paris Web 2010](http://www.paris-web.fr/2010/orateurs/olivier-thereaux.php) is outdated. Am I going to make sure I update it every time I move jobs or continent? Probably not. Does it bother me that it lies about me in the present tense? Somewhat.

Among billions of sentences written on the web in the present tense, most will become untrue sooner or later. Some will become significant witnesses of their time - others will simply keep being liars until they disappear. The difference, I believe, is as simple as it is powerful: some content is clearly dated - ideally with public visibility over when it was created, updated, and, heck, by whom. Others just state things in a context vacuum. Just date it.

Techniques and tools notwithstanding, a lot of what I have written so far is about making choices about the maintenance of information online. A way to make these choices easier and more codified is to craft a persistence policy for the web. An organisation like [the W3C](http://www.w3.org/) has a [very public policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Persistence.html) pledging substantial efforts to make resources on the www.w3.org Web site persistent. 

This is not just a matter for organisations - at a personal level, I have made (and documented) my persistence preference [on some online services](http://olivier.thereaux.net/2013/01-Goodbye-Instagram/) as well as [on my website](http://olivier.thereaux.net/2011/08/artisan-web/), where I tend to make an effort to update all the pages whenever I “redesign”, whatever the cost. Karl, on the other hand, has decided to keep  every page as-is when he changes the look of his site. Wandering through his archives, one can see how the site was in [2000](http://la-grange.net/2000/05/10), [2005](http://www.la-grange.net/2005/07/03.html) or [2010](http://la-grange.net/2010/10/06/dechets-plage), each page a faithful witness of its time. 

## Taxidermy and the digital panda breeding program

Sometimes, however, the choice is not ours. I already hinted at it in earlier examples, but more often than not, the author or caretaker of a piece of information is not the right person to make the right choice. Sometimes we are not around to make the choices at all - the huge information footprint left by people when they die is a growing concern, resulting in people drafting the digital will.

## Rust and patina of the web

 * La rouille
   - Bill Moggridge (ref séquence film: Objectified - 2 minutes) "materiau et objet qui se bonifie avec le temps et l'usage"
   - La rouille est un matériau vivant (Cf Ruskin). Symbole d'impermanence
   - la rouille détruit et protège
 * Comprendre son matériau
   - C'est la base du métier pour les architectes du bâti
   - Béton, bois... des qualités différentes et une réaction différente au temps
 * La patine et la degradation du web
   - pas similaire au domaine physique (jaunir, disparation croissante)
   - Personne ne sait encore ce qu'est la "patine" du web
   - Mémoire de l'utilisation - couches données et interactions au fil du temps
 * Notre profession est basée sur impermanence des supports et des technologies
   -  L'information n'échappe pas à l'impermanence.  
   - Accepter et apprécier la beauté de l'impermanence
   - Comprendre l'impact du temps et faire évoluer nos techniques vers plus de pérennité 
   - Donner la possibilité à la culture de se réaliser et de s'écrire.
   -  Nous ne savons rien du futur. Nous pouvons donner des ancres pour que le futur puisse s'accrocher au passé. Pour aider la construction et la création de nouveaux lieux.


* _decay_ - is not about degradation because most of the time digital information stays the same forever. On the contrary: decaying digital information is information that is not dated, not updated, not talked about, not findable. That information dies.
* _patina_ is not about information slowly disappearing or photos fading to yellow. Patina is not "vintage look" either - the design of 1990s website is cute and has a quaint feel but it is not patina. Patina is the "memory" of use, and the characteristics of things that are built to "get better with use". In the physical realm it is the sheen of wood polished and changed by the oil on our fingers. It is the colour of oxidation. In the digital realm, what is it? The accumulation of links, of content and metadata around information. Wikipedia or a page with a lot of incoming links and comments and commentary - is that a better example of web patina?


------


This is a conversation. One, ultimately, started by Tim Berners-Lee when he invented the web, or when he thundered that [Cool URIs don't change](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html). It owes a lot to a few thinkers and practitioners of the web, famous or not, each tackling the question from a different angle. To the librarians and archivists of the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/) and other organisations tackling the question of the legal deposit of digital artefacts. To Mark Boulton and his reflections on [Digital Patina](http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/digital-patina), to Stephanie Troeth and her [musings on bringing the aesthetics of impermanence to our medium](http://stephanietroeth.com/speaking). 

More precisely, this is the state of the conversation as witnessed and acted by [Karl](http://la-grange.net) and myself — the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of the web? — since our near simultaneous posts in late-2012, early 2013: his [Un site web de 1000 ans](http://www.24joursdeweb.fr/2012/un-site-web-de-1000-ans/) and my [Digital Decay](http://olivier.thereaux.net/2013/01-Digital-Decay/) tumbled into an exercise in open conference preparation: during the months running up to our talk at the Paris Web Conference, we chose to make [all our notes, thoughts and material](https://github.com/olivierthereaux/rustyweb) public on Github, as we are working on them.
